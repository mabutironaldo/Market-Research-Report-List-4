<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defoaming Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Defoaming agents are categorized into two main types: Type I and Type II. Type I defoaming agents are generally silicone-based and work by rapidly breaking surface foam bubbles. They are ideal for applications where quick foam control is needed. On the other hand, Type II defoaming agents are non-silicone-based and work by spreading over the liquid surface, forming a thin film to prevent foam formation. They are recommended for applications where long-lasting foam control is required. Both types play a crucial role in various industries to improve process efficiency.</p></p>
