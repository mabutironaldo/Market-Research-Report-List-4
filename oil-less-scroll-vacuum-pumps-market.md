<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-less Scroll Vacuum Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-sided Scroll</li><li>Double-sided Scroll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil-less scroll vacuum pumps are categorized into two main types: single-sided scroll and double-sided scroll pumps. Single-sided scroll pumps have a single orbiting scroll that moves in a circular motion within a stationary scroll, creating a vacuum without the need for oil lubrication. On the other hand, double-sided scroll pumps have two orbiting scrolls that move in opposite directions, providing higher levels of efficiency and vacuum capacity. Both types eliminate the need for oil lubrication, making them ideal for applications requiring clean and reliable vacuum technology.</p></p>
