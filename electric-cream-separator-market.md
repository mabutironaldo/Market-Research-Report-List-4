<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Cream Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hermetic Type</li><li>Non Hermetic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric cream separators can be categorized into two main types - hermetic type and non-hermetic type. Hermetic type cream separators are sealed units that prevent any outside air or contaminants from entering the milk during the separation process, ensuring high-quality results. On the other hand, non-hermetic type cream separators do not have this sealed design and may be more prone to contamination. Both types cater to different market segments based on the specific needs and preferences of consumers.</p></p>
