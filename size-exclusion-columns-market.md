<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Size Exclusion Columns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Empty Columns</li><li>Pre-packed Columns</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Size exclusion columns are used in chromatography to separate molecules based on size. There are three main types of size exclusion column markets: empty columns, pre-packed columns, and others. Empty columns require users to pack the stationary phase themselves, giving more control over the separation process. Pre-packed columns come filled with the stationary phase, saving time and effort. Other markets may include specialized columns for specific applications or unique column designs. Each type offers different advantages and considerations for users.</p></p>
