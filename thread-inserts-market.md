<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thread Inserts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tanged Thread Inserts</li><li>Tangless Thread Inserts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thread inserts can be categorized into two main types: Tanged Thread Inserts and Tangless Thread Inserts. Tanged thread inserts have a tang or prong that helps to install the insert into the threaded hole, while tangless inserts do not have a tang and rely on other methods for installation. Tanged inserts are commonly used in applications where high pull-out strength is required, while tangless inserts are preferred for applications where tang breakage is a concern. Both types offer unique advantages depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
