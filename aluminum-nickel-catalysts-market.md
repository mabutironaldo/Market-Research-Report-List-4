<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum-Nickel Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated</li><li>Non-activated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminum-Nickel Catalysts can be categorized into two main types: Activated and Non-activated. Activated catalysts have undergone a treatment process to enhance their reactivity and efficiency in catalyzing chemical reactions. These catalysts are typically more stable and have a higher surface area, making them ideal for various industrial applications. On the other hand, Non-activated catalysts have not undergone any treatment and are used as-is. They may be more cost-effective but are generally less efficient in catalytic reactions compared to activated catalysts.</p></p>
