<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Filtered Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pass</li><li>High Pass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Filtered connectors are divided into two main types: Low Pass and High Pass. Low Pass connectors allow frequencies below a certain cutoff point to pass through, while blocking higher frequencies. This type of connector is commonly used in applications where interference from high frequencies must be minimized. On the other hand, High Pass connectors allow frequencies above a certain cutoff point to pass through, while blocking lower frequencies. This type of connector is typically used in applications where only higher frequencies are desired.</p></p>
