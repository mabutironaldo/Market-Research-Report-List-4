<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Power Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Solar Pumps</li><li>AC Solar Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar power pump market consists of two main types of pumps: DC solar pumps and AC solar pumps. DC solar pumps are powered directly by solar panels, converting sunlight into electricity to drive the pump. They are suitable for smaller applications such as irrigation systems or livestock watering. AC solar pumps, on the other hand, require an inverter to convert the DC power generated by the solar panels into AC power, making them more suitable for larger applications such as municipal water supply systems.</p></p>
