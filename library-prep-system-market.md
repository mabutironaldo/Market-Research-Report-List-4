<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Library Prep System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Fully Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Library Prep Systems can be classified into two main types: Automatic and Fully Automatic. Automatic systems require some manual intervention during the library preparation process, such as sample loading and reagent addition, but largely automate other steps like mixing and incubation. Fully Automatic systems, on the other hand, are capable of performing the entire library preparation process without any manual intervention, from sample loading to final library construction. Both types of systems offer high-throughput capabilities and increased efficiency in next-generation sequencing workflows.</p></p>
