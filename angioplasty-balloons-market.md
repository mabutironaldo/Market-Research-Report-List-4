<p><h1>Angioplasty Balloons Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Application, Regional Outlook, Competitive Strategies, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Angioplasty Balloons Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Angioplasty balloons are medical devices used in a procedure called angioplasty, which is a minimally invasive procedure to open blocked or narrowed blood vessels. The balloons are inserted into the blood vessels and inflated to widen the vessel and improve blood flow.</p><p>The Angioplasty Balloons Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.46% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, rising geriatric population, and the advancements in technology leading to the development of innovative angioplasty balloons. Additionally, the growing awareness about minimally invasive procedures and the increasing adoption of angioplasty balloons for the treatment of coronary artery disease are also driving the market growth.</p><p>Some of the latest trends in the Angioplasty Balloons Market include the development of drug-eluting balloons, which are designed to prevent restenosis or the re-narrowing of blood vessels. Additionally, there is a growing focus on the use of bioresorbable balloons, which gradually dissolve in the body after the procedure, reducing the risk of long-term complications. The market is also witnessing an increasing number of collaborations and partnerships between medical device manufacturers to launch new and innovative products in the market.</p></p>
