<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Clean Room Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Turbulently Ventilated</li><li>Unidirectional Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial clean rooms can be classified into two main types based on airflow patterns: turbulently ventilated and unidirectional flow. In turbulently ventilated clean rooms, air flows in a non-linear, random manner, causing particles to be constantly mixed and redistributed throughout the room. On the other hand, in unidirectional flow clean rooms, air moves in a single direction, typically from ceiling to floor, ensuring that particles are carried away from the work area. Each type offers specific benefits and is chosen based on the desired level of cleanliness required for the industrial process.</p></p>
