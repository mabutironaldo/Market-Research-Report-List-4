<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tap Changer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OLTC</li><li>DETC/NLTC/OCTC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tap changers are devices used in transformers to regulate the voltage level by adjusting the number of turns in the transformer winding. On-Load Tap Changers (OLTC) allow for voltage regulation while the transformer is energized, while De-Energized Tap Changers (DETC), No-Load Tap Changers (NLTC), and Off-Circuit Tap Changers (OCTC) necessitate the transformer to be de-energized during adjustment. OLTCs are commonly used in high-load applications, while DETCs, NLTCs, and OCTCs are preferred for low-load scenarios where power interruptions are acceptable.</p></p>
