<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Type</li><li>Normal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hard CMP pads can be classified into two main types: Abrasive Type and Normal Type. Abrasive Type pads are designed for more aggressive material removal during the CMP process, making them suitable for applications that require a high level of planarity and uniformity. On the other hand, Normal Type pads are used for less aggressive polishing, making them ideal for achieving a smoother surface finish. Both types of pads cater to different market needs in terms of material removal rate and surface quality.</p></p>
