<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED Surgical Lamps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cool Surgical Lamps</li><li>Warm Surgical Lamps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LED surgical lamps are divided into two main types based on the color temperature of the light they emit: cool surgical lamps and warm surgical lamps. Cool surgical lamps produce a brighter and cooler white light that helps enhance visibility and focus during surgical procedures. On the other hand, warm surgical lamps emit a softer and warmer light that is less harsh on the eyes and can help reduce eye strain for medical professionals during long surgeries. Both types of LED surgical lamps offer unique benefits for different surgical environments and preferences.</p></p>
