<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Motor Grader Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Six-wheel (Three-axle) Motor Grader</li><li>Four-wheel (Two-axle) Motor Grader</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Six-wheel (Three-axle) Motor Graders are typically larger in size and have more power. They are designed for heavy-duty grading and leveling tasks on large construction sites. These motor graders offer better stability and traction due to the additional wheels and axles, making them suitable for challenging terrains.</p><p>On the other hand, Four-wheel (Two-axle) Motor Graders are smaller in size and more maneuverable. They are ideal for smaller construction projects or tight spaces where a larger motor grader may not be practical. These motor graders are easier to transport and operate, making them a popular choice for smaller contractors or landscaping projects.</p></p>
