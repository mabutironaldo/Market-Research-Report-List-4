<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Grease Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-priming</li><li>Submersible</li><li>Suction Head</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric grease pumps are commonly classified into three main types based on their functionality: self-priming, submersible, and suction head pumps. Self-priming pumps are able to create a vacuum to draw grease into the pump without the need for manual priming. Submersible pumps are designed to be fully submerged in the grease container for efficient operation. Suction head pumps are capable of pulling grease from a container located below the pump, relying on the pump's suction power to draw in the grease.</p></p>
