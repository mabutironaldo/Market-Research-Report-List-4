<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coil Assisted Flow Diverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wide-neck</li><li>Narrow-neck</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coil Assisted Flow Diverters are devices used in endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. They can be categorized into two main types based on the neck size of the aneurysm: Wide-neck and Narrow-neck. Wide-neck diverters are designed for aneurysms with a larger opening, requiring more support to prevent blood flow. Narrow-neck diverters, on the other hand, are used for aneurysms with a smaller opening, providing precise and targeted treatment. Both types offer effective solutions for treating different types of aneurysms.</p></p>
