<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Incremental Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Rotary Encoder</li><li>Incremental Linear Encoder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The optical incremental encoder market consists of two main types: incremental rotary encoders and incremental linear encoders. Incremental rotary encoders track the rotation of a shaft by producing a series of pulses as the shaft turns, providing feedback on position and speed. Incremental linear encoders, on the other hand, measure linear movement along a straight path by producing pulse signals as the object being measured moves. Both types of encoders play a crucial role in industrial automation, robotics, and motion control applications.</p></p>
