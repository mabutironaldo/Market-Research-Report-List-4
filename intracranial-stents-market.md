<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-expandable Stents</li><li>Balloon-expanded Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial stents are medical devices used to treat blockages or narrowing of blood vessels in the brain. There are two main types of intracranial stents: self-expandable stents and balloon-expanded stents. Self-expandable stents are designed to expand on their own once inserted into the blood vessel, providing support and keeping the vessel open. Balloon-expanded stents, on the other hand, are inflated with a balloon catheter to expand and push the blockage against the vessel wall. Both types of stents have their own unique advantages and applications in treating intracranial vascular diseases.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial stents are used in the treatment of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. In ischemic strokes, the stents are utilized to open up blocked blood vessels in the brain, restoring blood flow and preventing further damage. In hemorrhagic strokes, stents can be used to reinforce weakened blood vessel walls or divert blood flow away from the affected area, reducing the risk of re-bleeding. Overall, intracranial stents play a crucial role in improving outcomes and reducing complications in stroke patients.</p></p>
