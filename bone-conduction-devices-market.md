<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Conduction Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BAHA</li><li>Bone Conduction Headphones</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone conduction devices are hearing aids that bypass the outer and middle ear to send sound vibrations directly to the inner ear. There are two main types of bone conduction devices on the market: Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA) and bone conduction headphones. BAHA devices are surgically implanted and are commonly used for individuals with conductive hearing loss. On the other hand, bone conduction headphones are non-invasive and can be worn like traditional headphones, allowing individuals with hearing impairments to listen to audio without blocking their ears.</p></p>
