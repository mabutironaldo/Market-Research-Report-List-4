<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OBD Interface Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OBD-I</li><li>OBD-II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>OBD interfaces are divided into two main types: OBD-I and OBD-II. OBD-I refers to the first generation of onboard diagnostics systems, which were introduced in the early 1980s. OBD-I systems are limited in terms of the data they can capture and the diagnostic trouble codes they can provide. On the other hand, OBD-II is the second generation of onboard diagnostics systems, mandated for all vehicles sold in the US from 1996 onwards. OBD-II systems offer more comprehensive and standardized diagnostics capabilities compared to OBD-I.</p></p>
