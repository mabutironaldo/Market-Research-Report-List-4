<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Anchor Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suture anchor devices are used in orthopedic and sports medicine surgeries to repair soft tissues to bone. There are two main types of suture anchor devices: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable anchors gradually degrade and are absorbed by the body over time, promoting natural healing. Non-absorbable anchors provide long-term stability and are made of materials like metal or polyether ether ketone (PEEK). Surgeons choose between these two types based on the specific needs of the patient and the nature of the injury being treated.</p></p>
